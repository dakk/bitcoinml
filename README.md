Bitcoin data-structures library for OCaml.

## Features

Bitcoinml provides support for the following data-structures:
- Address
- Block
- Block_lazy (lazy block evaluation)
- Hash
- Merkleroot
- Script (script execution, common pattern recognizer)
- Tx (In, Out, Witness)
- Varint (CompactSize)
- Params (network parameters for BTC, XTN and BCH)

### Segwit
The library is now fully compatible with segwit transactions (from version 0.3.0). The parser automatically recognizes
a segwit transaction, and parses/serializes it correctly. For those who want to avoid this behaviour, there are the
`*_legacy` functions which disable segwit.

### Sexp serialization
For every type of the library, bitcoinml also offers sexp `to_string` readable serialization:

```sexp
(
    (hash 8139979112e894a14f8370438a471d23984061ff83a9eba0bc7a34433327ec21)
    (version 1)
    (txin(
        (
            (out_hash 56f87210814c8baef7068454e517a70da2f2103fc3ac7f687e32a228dc80e115)
            (out_n 3)
            (script(((OP_DATA 22 00141d7cd6c75c2e86f4cbf98eaed221b30bd9a0b928))23))
            (witness_script(            
                (3045022100f764287d3e99b1474da9bec7f7ed236d6c81e793b20c4b5aa1f3051b9a7daa63022016a198031d5554dbb855bdbe8534776a4be6958bd8d530dc001c32b828f6f0ab01 038262a6c6cec93c2d3ecd6c6072efea86d02ff8e3328bbd0242b20af3425990ac)))
            (sequence -1))))
    (txout(
        (
            (value 99987100)
            (script((OP_DUP OP_HASH160(OP_DATA 20 1d7cd6c75c2e86f4cbf98eaed221b30bd9a0b928)OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG)25)))))
    (locktime 0)
    (size 108)
    (vsize 136)
    (witness((
        (hash 6bf4e4dfb860cf0906f49c836700b130ac78cc391c72a0911c94cdec4dcb10ec)
        (marker 0)
        (flag 1)
        (size 110))))
)
```

This implies that for each type there are the ```t_of_sexp``` and ```sexp_of_t``` conversion functions.
